The main thing is the iBreak processing program.  You'll need to install the OSCP5 library in processing to develop.  The repo also includes a program called FaceOSC in the sketch's data directory, and it
launches that program when you start (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker).  Should work for windows and mac.  Easiest to get started with the windows and mac builds from the releases section

keys:


* LEFT/RIGHT -- guess which way the grating is going.  If it's pointing up and to the right, guess 'right'.  up and to the left, guess left

* UP/DOWN -- change the coarseness of the grating.  Helpful if your eyes are particularly strong or weak at these distances.

* 'b' -- toggle blanking the text, so it's just color cues -- sometimes text can be distracting


colors:

* Yellow:  move forwards

* Red:  move backwards

* Green:  guess left/right
